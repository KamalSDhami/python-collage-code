1 write a python program to generate a fibonacci series when the serries will start from - and 1 and should be less than n consider n =22

2. write a python program to check whether the given string is palindrome.

3. write a python program to print the factorial of a number n 

4. write a pyhton program for given tasks:
a)consider the given array and print the sum of all the numbers 
arr =[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

b) consider the given array and rotate it to the right by k steps [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] ->[10,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] consider k =2

c) consider the given array and find the occurance of k 
[1,2,2,26,5,4,4,4,6,6,82,2,1,2,2]. consider k =2
